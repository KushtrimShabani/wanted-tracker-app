- [x] 7. Create main server file (server/index.js) with middleware setup
- [x] 8. Implement FBI API proxy routes in server/routes/wanted.js:
  - [x] GET /api/wanted - List with pagination
  - [x] GET /api/wanted/search - Search functionality
  - [x] GET /api/wanted/:id - Individual person details
  - [x] GET /api/wanted/filters/options - Filter options
- [x] 9. Add 5-minute in-memory caching with node-cache
- [x] 10. Implement error handling and validation
- [x] 11. Add health check endpoint
- [x] 12. Create comprehensive backend tests with Jest + Supertest
- [x] 13. Create backend Dockerfile

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [x] 14. Set up React 18 + Vite project structure
- [x] 15. Install dependencies (react-router-dom, zustand, tailwindcss)
- [x] 16. Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- [x] 17. Create Zustand store for state management (client/src/store/wantedStore.js)
- [x] 18. Implement core components:
  - [x] Header with navigation
  - [x] SearchBar with debounced search
  - [x] FilterPanel for hair color and race filtering
  - [x] WantedCard for person display
  - [x] LoadingSpinner for loading states
  - [x] ErrorBoundary for error handling
  - [x] Toast for notifications
- [x] 19. Create page components:
  - [x] WantedList with infinite scroll/pagination
  - [x] WantedDetail for individual person view
- [x] 20. Implement routing with React Router 6
- [x] 21. Add responsive design with mobile-first approach
- [x] 22. Create frontend tests with React Testing Library
- [x] 23. Create frontend Dockerfile with Nginx

### Phase 4: Testing Implementation
- [x] 24. Set up Jest configuration for both frontend and backend
- [x] 25. Create comprehensive test suites:
  - [x] Backend API route tests
  - [x] Frontend component tests
  - [x] Store/state management tests
- [x] 26. Mock external API calls in tests
- [x] 27. Ensure â‰¥80% test coverage for all metrics
- [x] 28. Add test scripts to package.json files

### Phase 5: Docker & DevOps
- [x] 29. Create docker-compose.yml for multi-container setup
- [x] 30. Configure Nginx for frontend with API proxy
- [x] 31. Set up Docker networking between services
- [x] 32. Add health checks for both services
- [x] 33. Configure environment variables
- [x] 34. Test full Docker deployment

### Phase 6: Code Quality & Documentation
- [x] 35. Set up ESLint and Prettier configurations
- [x] 36. Add code formatting and linting scripts
- [x] 37. Create comprehensive README.md with:
  - [x] Setup instructions
  - [x] API documentation
  - [x] Docker usage guide
  - [x] Testing guidelines
  - [x] Troubleshooting section
- [x] 38. Document environment variables
- [x] 39. Add performance optimization notes
- [x] 40. Include security considerations

### Phase 7: Final Testing & Validation
- [x] 41. Verify all API endpoints return valid FBI data
- [x] 42. Test complete Docker Compose setup
- [x] 43. Validate frontend/backend integration
- [x] 44. Confirm responsive design works on mobile/desktop
- [x] 45. Run full test suite and verify coverage
- [x] 46. Performance test with Lighthouse (target â‰¥90 mobile)
- [x] 47. Security audit of configurations
- [x] 48. Final code review and cleanup
